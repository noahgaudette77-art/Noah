# Visual upgrade: progress log

A checkpoint file so this work can resume cleanly if a session is cut off.
Rules for the whole job: **visuals only** (question bank, answer checking, scoring,
boss HP, progression and timing are untouched), and the game is never left
half-edited: each checkpoint builds, passes the regression test and is committed.

## How to check a build

```bash
npm run arcade            # rebuild arcade/index.html
npm run arcade:regress    # play 81 scripted right/wrong answers and compare every
                          # HP, heart, score, nest egg, shield, wave, question and
                          # frame number against the pre-upgrade build
```

`arcade/backup/index.before-visual-upgrade.html` is the game exactly as it was
before this work (open it in a browser to compare). `regression-baseline.json`
next to it is the trace that build produces.

## Checkpoints

| # | Checkpoint | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Backup, regression test, "before" screenshots | done |
| 1 | The car | next |
| 2 | The bosses (a different cyborg for each of the 12) | todo |
| 3 | World and events (traffic, Event Director, biomes, feedback) | todo |
| 4 | Post-FX toggles, Reduced effects, quality tiers, performance | todo |

## Done so far

- Checkpoint 0: backup copy saved; `scripts/arcade-regression.js` written and
  verified repeatable (two runs of the same build give identical traces; the final
  boss goes 200 > 180 on the first right answer).

## Next

- Checkpoint 1: car detail (layered armor, panel lines, wheels, light bar, brake
  glow, underglow, exhaust heat), suspension bounce, steering lean, tire spray.

## Known issues

- None yet.

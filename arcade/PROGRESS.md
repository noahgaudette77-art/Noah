# Visual upgrade: progress log

A checkpoint file so this work can resume cleanly if a session is cut off.
Rules for the whole job: **visuals only** (question bank, answer checking, scoring,
boss HP, progression and timing are untouched), and the game is never left
half-edited: each checkpoint builds, passes the regression test and is committed.

## How to check a build

```bash
npm run arcade            # rebuild arcade/index.html
npm run arcade:regress    # play 81 scripted right/wrong answers and compare every
                          # HP, heart, score, nest egg, shield, wave, question and
                          # frame number against the pre-upgrade build
```

`arcade/backup/index.before-visual-upgrade.html` is the game exactly as it was
before this work (open it in a browser to compare). `regression-baseline.json`
next to it is the trace that build produces.

## Checkpoints

| # | Checkpoint | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Backup, regression test, "before" screenshots | done |
| 1 | The car | done |
| 2 | The bosses (a different cyborg for each of the 12) | next |
| 3 | World and events (traffic, Event Director, biomes, feedback) | todo |
| 4 | Post-FX toggles, Reduced effects, quality tiers, performance | todo |

## Done so far

- Checkpoint 0: backup copy saved; `scripts/arcade-regression.js` written and
  verified repeatable (two runs of the same build give identical traces; the final
  boss goes 200 > 180 on the first right answer).

- Checkpoint 1 (car): new module `src/js/21b-racercar.js`. Chamfered, bolted armor
  in layers; bull bar, winch, headlights; hood scoop and vents; armored pillars and
  roof; seven-slat louvred rear window; working roof light bar (amber chase under
  1 Hz per lamp); ducktail wing with mint lip; segmented tail lamps that brighten
  under braking; tubular rear guard; twin exhausts that glow after a boost with heat
  haze behind them (a new `GFX.heatAt` in the final pass); five-spoke pale rims,
  treaded tyres, brake discs that glow, calipers; mint under-glow; headlight shafts;
  tyre spray; contact shadow on the road. The body rides on springs (heave, roll in
  lane changes, squat under boost, dive under braking) over wheels that stay on the
  road and spin. Regression: identical. Software-render fps test (no GPU, phone
  size): 94 fps in the worst second.

## Next

- Checkpoint 2: `src/js/22b-cyborg.js`, a cyborg kit with a different design for
  each of the 12 bosses; idle, telegraph, hit, damage states, rage, entrance.

## Known issues

- None yet.
